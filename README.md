# Tableau-Datasource
Message when publishing a datasource: Tableau bridge required for on-premises data. If Tableau Cloud can't connect directly to this datasource, it will use a Tableau Bridge client to keep this data fresh.

If youâ€™re using Tableau Cloud, and one of the sources (e.g., Oracle) is on-prem, you may need Tableau Bridge, and limitations might apply for federated extracts.
